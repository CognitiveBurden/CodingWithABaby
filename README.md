## Having the baby
### Pregnancy
+ What technology can you use to help with pregnancy?
    * services tell you how big your baby is and what is developing
    * TODO: List some services for use during pregnancy and why we used them
+ You will be debugging in production
    * It is like having a test suite where the names of the tests are A,B,2,4,5...yes you know there is an issue, but you have no idea what the issue is.

### RPI (Reduce Project Impact)
+ Plan for extended time off
    * You will have many months to inform your project leaders about the upcoming baby
    * Tell them when you feel comfortable ?after first trimester

    * For the first baby I took one week off to start with the new baby and wife
        - Then I took another week at 1 month to watch the baby while my wife started work
        - I used FMLA for the next 4 months to take off every Wednesday to spend with the baby (unpaid)
    * For the second baby, my wife was taking more time, and I started a new job
        - I phoned a friend, and got an old co-worker to come in and keep my project going, thanks Ben
        - So I only took a week off
    * For both I communicated clearly with everyone on my Service Level Agreement, and when I would be available
        - In my experience if you give people enough warning of the changes that will occur they are very supportive and excited for you
        - When and if you will respond to emails or phone calls
+ Remove yourself as primary on anything
    * Help others prepare to take on your responsiblities
    * You will be out for a bit, make sure others know how to do your work
    * as you get closer to the delivery date, begin taking on non-critical tasks
        - At the end of the day ensure someone knows where you are on tasks
+ Form relationships with your co workers
    * Create your own support network
    * You will need there help as your brain power diminishes due to sleep deprivation


### The Delivery
+ Don't pass out
    * TODO: Picture of husband passed out in delivery room with nurses surrounding

#### Entertainment
+ Delivery may take a while prepare you and your spouse for the long haul
+ I used some technology to help during the delivery of each of our children
    * Made playlist
        - Relaxing
        - Exciting
    * Used bluetooth speaker for music, so could stay close to my wife and control the music
+ Don't forget chargers for cell phones and other devices you have packed in your bags
        
#### Pictures
* Do take picutes of your newborn
* Do not take pictures of your baby coming out...no one want to see that
    - Talk to your spouse on what shoud be recorded and what should not

#### Informing others
+ Make a list of people you want to email or txt
    * Include someone at work, so they know what is going on
    * Draft an email
    * Facebook
    * Use a service
        - TODO: List services
+ Maybe don't tweet your centimeters dialated...TMI


### Early years

    * TODO: List some apps I used
+ Technology and apps to help secure your home for house hold accidents
    * TODO: Find nationwides "Make Safe Happen Mobile Application"
        - http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/make-safe-happen
    * Maybe this should go in a different section b/c it is after being born...to stick to you timeline, but maybe this fits in b/c we will be taking care off all the baby stuff here

##  The New Reality strategies to cope with your limited time
+ The new reality is you have less time on your hands.
    * TODO: find way to info graphic show less time or research the amount of time you lose when you have a baby
        - Instead just make it up...when you were single in college you had 6 hours of school and 18 hours of free time, when you got married it was like 8 hours of work 4 hours with wife 8 hours sleep 4 hours free time, when you have a baby...8 hours of work, 8 hours with the baby 4 hours for wife and 4 hours sleep.
    * Your coworkers may talk about exotic topics like "Free Time", having slept poorly because they only got 7 hours of sleep, and drinking beer
    * You will grace your coworkers with pictures that can never truely capture the pure joy of a smile and the feeling a baby snuggled in for a midday nap
        - TODO: pictures of boys smiling

### Get organized 
+ TODOIST
+ Sunrise Calendar
+ Outlook app for IOS
+ Pomodoro's
    * 30/30 App
    * Stay focused "Music to Code By"
        - http://mtcb.pwop.com/

### Keeping up with whats new
+ Use the time you have available
    * Podcasts during driving
    * Videos while holding baby
        - Invest in a tablet and bluetooth headphones, preferrably without blinking lights
+ Find the aggregators of the world to help give you breadth 
+ Find the experts of your field to give you depth
+ Spend some time each week staging content for you
+ Select a topic and spend a couple of weeks diving into that topic
+ Having the content staged will ensure that you can continue learning on one topic
+ Be mobile...you will get short bursts on time...utilize them to acheive something
    * You never know when a baby will pass out...most likely while walking through mall
        - Man I wish I had that article I was reading
+ 
+ Use conferences as a way to jump start interesting topics
    * I like to create items on the todo list as a take away item from each session I attend
+ Find a friend
    * Just 

### Work Life balance
+ talk about exercise and 7 minute workouts
+ Take some time to be alone with your significant other, get a baby sitter your child will be fine

### Other
+ Changes in your engagement as a result of the new baby
    * You will have less time for overtime...good planning is needed to limit overtime
    * You will be fuzzy from lack of sleep
        - My CoWorkers kept a running total of number of days without good sleep
        - Form relationships with your team members, projects and teams work in an eb and flow style. You will need their help when you are diminished due to sleep deprivation. 
    * Less time to dive into problems at night
    * TODO: Move this whole section to after birth.

## Children with Technology
### Protect Devices
+ put bumpers on devices
+ Secure devices from innappropriate access
    * http://lifehacker.com/5946947/how-can-i-kid-proof-my-pc-and-gadgets

### Notes from the corner office (Tech leaders)
+ TODO: Would like more sources for this part, don't want to be single sourced
+ Industry leaders limit the technology their kids can use
    * Steve Job's did not allow gadgets at dinner table, and talk about books, history, and other things
    * Bill Gates - held off his daugther from hard-core computer use until 10 and limits game play to 45 minutes
    * Chris Anderson, former editor of Wired, institute time limit an parental control on all devices in the house
        - No screens in the bedroom
    * Evan Williams, founder of Blogger, Twitter, and Medium gave children hundreds of books instead of ipads
    * Ali Partovi, a founder of iLike and advisor to facebook, dinstinguishes passive vs active media interactions
    * Dick Costolo, chief executive of Twitter, decided to allow unlimited usage but only in the living room
    * 
    * Why?
        - Studies show that excessive media can lead to attention problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders
            + The American Academy of Pediatrics children and teens should engage with entertainment media for no more than one to two hourse per day.
            + there is no educational value in screen time for kids under 2
        - sleep disorder
        - obesity
            + more exposure to marketing
        - behavioral problems
        - Academic performance
        - violence - desensitized
        - Less time for play - active or creative
        - Limit exposure to harmful content, porn
        - Bullying from other kids
        - Addiction to devices
        - Want to foster imagination, creativity, and wonder
            + Our generation has created some amazing things, but we all started without ubiquitous tech
        - all these playtime gadgets can distance families, hurt academic success, and pose the risk of addiction
        - If you don't let kids have some access they may binge when they get older
    * How can you implement these strategies?
        - Talk about how reducing sitting and encouraging movement promotes a health life
        - Be a good role model in your use of electronics in front of children
        - Log the amount of time child in front of any screen, computer, phone, tablet, DS, etc
        - set screen time limits
        - Create screen free bedrooms
        - Meal Time == Family Time, no gadgets
        - Provide other habits, family exercise, reading physical books
        - Don't use screen time as reward or punishment, b/c makes devices seem more important
        - encourage active screen time, jumping jacks on commercials 
### Digital Guardians
* How do we manage our children's digital persona?
    - Do you put pictures and names of children on public websites
    - How do you communicate about your children to others
    - Do you reserve digital domains for your children?
    - Can we give our children a leg up on creating an easily identifiable digital persona?

### How to teach coding
+ There are some good apps to help teach coding
    * Koadable 
    * Hopscotch
    * Scratch

### The problem
+ annecdotes about coding with children

+ Your co-workers may talk about exotic things like "Free Time", Drinking Beer, and Sleeping for 10 hours
+ Listening to a podcast or watching a tech talk with the baby is sleeping on you is totally far game
  + Just remember to prep everything you are going to need before your wife hands over the baby
  + Best thing I ever bought for use with my IPad bluetooth headset
+ You are going to forget things
  + Get a todo list
  + I like Todoist
  + I like LastPass
  + I like sunrise calendar
  + The new Outlook App is great at consolidating your life
+ Your kids are only young once, so try not to use the electronic baby sitter too much
+ If the baby is not crying ... don't bother it
+ Warn your co-workers you will not be firing on all cylinders
+ Know that your temper will be short and relax
+ You will eventually get all your smarts back
+ You will wonder what you did with all your time before kids
  + we would sleep till 9 am on Sundays, then make waffles and watch meet the press. Is George Bush still the President?
+ If your wife is on maternity leave see if you can trade her some early even hours for a contiguous block of sleep for you
  + 6 hours of contiguous sleep is worth more than 8 hours of interrupted sleep
  + Remind your wife that this will be the only time this child is a baby and that she should take more maternity time
+ Discuss with your wife the plan of attack in the middle of the night, make sure she is explicit
  + You will reach a point where you will rationalize not following the plan so you can get more sleep
+ There are apps which time how long a baby has feed, when was the last time you changed the baby, and how many times it has peed...use them
+ All time which you have to be away from your child becomes precious to your career.
  + Use commute time to catch up on podcasts
  + lunch breaks should still be used to break away from your project's issues, but you can and should use that time to further a goal
+ No matter how cute and wonderful your baby is...you will think ok, that thing is awesome, can I go back to work now?
+ Interestingly enough your co-workers are NOT interested in color or consistency of your child's poop
+ If you can go out to a company happy hour, it will seem like a vegas style oasis, big lights lots of excitement and booze
  + about 20 minutes into the happy hour you will be wondering if your kid is doing something amazing
+ Your threshold of entertainment is lowered dramatically
  + You will put the baby on a blanket in the middle of the room and just stare at it...note it won't do anything
  + after about 2 - 3 months your baby will smile at you, and you will simultaneously think two things. 1) It is about time you did something anything 2) I will do anything...literally anything for you to smile at me again
    + A baby's smile and laugh is the purest form of joy
    + you will try to create an infinit loop of smiles and laughs
+ Do not take picture of the baby coming out with your phone...your wife will not appreciate it...had to learn that the hard way
+ Exercise becomes a lower priority
  + Try 7 minute workouts in the morning
+ Find a babysitter and go out every once in awhile
  + the baby will be fine
  + you and your wife will be better for it
+ Make no bones about it for a significant period of time after the baby is born...you will be in survival mode
+ My threshold for raising my children is to limit sever head trama till they are older than 1
+ While the iphone is a great invention...zipper pajama's were created by a true genius
  + snap pajamas are more difficult than writting a web app in assembly
    + button pajamas - forget about it - it is like coding blind folded
