    * For the second baby, my wife was taking more time, and I started a new job
        - I phoned a friend, and got an old co-worker to come in and keep my project going, thanks Ben
        - So I only took a week off
    * For both I communicated clearly with everyone on my Service Level Agreement, and when I would be available

+ The new reality is you have less time on your hands.
    * TODO: find way to info graphic show less time or research the amount of time you lose when you have a baby
        - Instead just make it up...when you were single in college you had 6 hours of school and 18 hours of free time, when you got married it was like 8 hours of work 4 hours with wife 8 hours sleep 4 hours free time, when you have a baby...8 hours of work, 8 hours with the baby 4 hours for wife and 4 hours sleep.
    * Your coworkers may talk about exotic topics like "Free Time", having slept poorly because they only got 7 hours of sleep, and drinking beer
    * You will grace your coworkers with pictures that can never truely capture the pure joy of a smile and the feeling a baby snuggled in for a midday nap
        - TODO: pictures of boys smiling

        - http://mtcb.pwop.com/

### Keeping up with whats new
+ Use the time you have available
    * Podcasts during driving
    * Videos while holding baby
        - Invest in a tablet and bluetooth headphones, preferrably without blinking lights
+ Find the aggregators of the world to help give you breadth 
+ Find the experts of your field to give you depth
+ Spend some time each week staging content for you
+ Select a topic and spend a couple of weeks diving into that topic
+ Having the content staged will ensure that you can continue learning on one topic
+ Be mobile...you will get short bursts on time...utilize them to acheive something
    * You never know when a baby will pass out...most likely while walking through mall
        - Man I wish I had that article I was reading
+ 
+ Use conferences as a way to jump start interesting topics
    * I like to create items on the todo list as a take away item from each session I attend
+ Find a friend
    * Just like a spotter at the gym or workout buddy, someone to push you and make you better

### Work Life balance
+ talk about exercise and 7 minute workouts
    * TODO: App for 7 minute workout
+ Take some time to be alone with your significant other, get a baby sitter your child will be fine

### Other
+ Changes in your daily work engagement as a result of the new baby
    * You will have less time for overtime...good planning is needed to limit overtime
    * You will be fuzzy from lack of sleep
        - My CoWorkers kept a running total of number of days without good sleep
        - Form relationships with your team members, projects and teams work in an eb and flow style. You will need their help when you are diminished due to sleep deprivation. 
    * Less time to dive into problems at night
    * TODO: Move this whole section to after birth.

## Children with Technology
### Protect Devices
+ put bumpers on devices
+ Secure devices from innappropriate access
    * http://lifehacker.com/5946947/how-can-i-kid-proof-my-pc-and-gadgets

### Notes from the corner office (Tech leaders)
+ Common Sense Media did study and found about half of all families with incomes over 75,000 had downloaded apps for their young children
    * Amoung all children under 2 they average 53 minutes of tv or dvds more than twice the average time children are read to, 23 minutes
    * Almost one third of children under 2 have tv in their bedroom
    * 12 percent of children 2 to 4 use a computer every day, and 24 percent use it once a week
+ Stats on average usage
    * By 3 months old, 40% of children regularly consume electronic media.  By 24 months, 90%.
    * Screen Time Trends for kids under 6:
        *   52% of kids under 1 watched daily TV (30% watched videos), 2.5 hours/day
        *   60% of 1 year-olds watched TV; 47% videos; 3 hours/day
        *   71% of  2 year-olds watched TV; 53% videos; 3+ hours/day
+ There is a trend of decreased screen time from 2 hours 16 minutes in 2011 to only 1 hour 55 minutes in 2013
    * Increase of 10% in mobile usage
    * https://www.commonsensemedia.org/zero-to-eight-2013-infographic       
+ American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) discourages screen time for kids under 2 and advises limiting daily screen time to one to two hours for older kids.
+ Industry leaders limit the technology their kids can use
    * Steve Job's did not allow gadgets at dinner table, and talk about books, history, and other things
    * Bill Gates - held off his daugther from hard-core computer use until 10 and limits game play to 45 minutes
        - His son asked if he was going to have limits on screen time his whole life? Bill said "when you move away you can set your own screen limits."
    * Chris Anderson, former editor of Wired, institute time limit an parental control on all devices in the house
        - No screens in the bedroom
    * Evan Williams, founder of Blogger, Twitter, and Medium gave children hundreds of books instead of ipads
    * Ali Partovi, a founder of iLike and advisor to facebook, dinstinguishes passive vs active media interactions
    * Dick Costolo, chief executive of Twitter, decided to allow unlimited usage but only in the living room
    * 
    * Why?
        - Studies show that excessive media can lead to attention problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders
            + The American Academy of Pediatrics children and teens should engage with entertainment media for no more than one to two hourse per day.
            + there is no educational value in screen time for kids under 2
        - sleep disorder
        - obesity
            + more exposure to marketing
        - behavioral problems
        - Academic performance
        - violence - desensitized
        - Less time for play - active or creative
        - Limit exposure to harmful content, porn
        - Bullying from other kids
        - Addiction to devices
        - Want to foster imagination, creativity, and wonder
            + Our generation has created some amazing things, but we all started without ubiquitous tech
        - all these playtime gadgets can distance families, hurt academic success, and pose the risk of addiction
        - If you don't let kids have some access they may binge when they get older
        - Reduction in fine motor skills because of too much time with touch devices
    * How can you implement these strategies?
        - Talk about how reducing sitting and encouraging movement promotes a health life
        - Be a good role model in your use of electronics in front of children
        - Log the amount of time child in front of any screen, computer, phone, tablet, DS, etc
        - set screen time limits
        - Create screen free bedrooms
        - Meal Time == Family Time, no gadgets
        - Provide other habits, family exercise, reading physical books
        - Don't use screen time as reward or punishment, b/c makes devices seem more important
        - encourage active screen time, jumping jacks on commercials 
        - No gadgets during the week and only 30 min to 2 hours on weekend
        - Some parent do not let their teens have social media accounts except services like snapchat which delete messages after they are sent
        - Differentiate passive consumption from creation time, which is similar to playing piano or writing
        - Some Silicon Valley parents send their kids to Waldorf School in Los Altos, which focuses on hands on learing, so there are no computers
        - 
### Digital Guardians
* How do we manage our children's digital persona?
    - Do you put pictures and names of children on public websites
    - How do you communicate about your children to others
    - Do you reserve digital domains for your children?
    - Can we give our children a leg up on creating an easily identifiable digital persona?
        + Squat on accounts?
    - TODO: Some other services which are ephemeral like Snapchat which deletes messages
* Personal Privacy refers to you kid's online reputation
* Consumer Privacy refers to data companies can collect about your kids during online interactions and transactions
* Use strict privacy settings in apps and websites
* Know your kids passwords to social media sites
* Teach kids to be aware of personal information they are giving away online
* The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, prevents kid-targeted websites and apps from collecting data on kids younger than 13 without parental consent
* Never let kid share name, school's name, age,phone number, email, home address with strangers
* Never open email from strangers

### How to teach coding

******************************************************************************
# Old Stuff
******************************************************************************

+ Your co-workers may talk about exotic things like "Free Time", Drinking Beer, and Sleeping for 10 hours
+ Your kids are only young once, so try not to use the electronic baby sitter too much
+ Warn your co-workers you will not be firing on all cylinders
+ You will eventually get all your smarts back
+ If your wife is on maternity leave see if you can trade her some early even hours for a contiguous block of sleep for you
  + 6 hours of contiguous sleep is worth more than 8 hours of interrupted sleep
  + Remind your wife that this will be the only time this child is a baby and that she should take more maternity time
+ Discuss with your wife the plan of attack in the middle of the night, make sure she is explicit
  + You will reach a point where you will rationalize not following the plan so you can get more sleep
+ No matter how cute and wonderful your baby is...you will think ok, that thing is awesome, can I go back to work now?
+ Interestingly enough your co-workers are NOT interested in color or consistency of your child's poop
+ If you can go out to a company happy hour, it will seem like a vegas style oasis, big lights lots of excitement and booze
  + about 20 minutes into the happy hour you will be wondering if your kid is doing something amazing
+ Your threshold of entertainment is lowered dramatically
  + You will put the baby on a blanket in the middle of the room and just stare at it...note it won't do anything
  + after about 2 - 3 months your baby will smile at you, and you will simultaneously think two things. 1) It is about time you did something anything 2) I will do anything...literally anything for you to smile at me again
    + A baby's smile and laugh is the purest form of joy
    + you will try to create an infinit loop of smiles and laughs
+ Do not take picture of the baby coming out with your phone...your wife will not appreciate it...had to learn that the hard way
+ Make no bones about it for a significant period of time after the baby is born...you will be in survival mode
+ While the iphone is a great invention...zipper pajama's were created by a true genius
  + snap pajamas are more difficult than writting a web app in assembly
    + button pajamas - forget about it - it is like coding blind folded
    

## Extra Notes
+ Goals are achieved and inch at a time, in order to move your goal forward you can spend an hour every evening
	+ so you need to break up your goals into small chunks
	+ a way to store your tasks, so that you can jump into the flow as quickly as possible
+ http://blog.codinghorror.com/on-parenthood/
	+ a good article on a parent and developer, kind of emotional stuff
+ http://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/09/06/development-and-parenting/
	+ article about how being a parent is like developing software
+   Online presence later in life - be afraid of how this might impact them in the future
