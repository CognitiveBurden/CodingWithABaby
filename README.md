Did you know there are apps to track your child's every sleeping and waking moment, as well as groups of apps which integrate to streamline your daily workflow, so you can spend more time with your family? Come and learn how a developer can survive having a baby with tips, tricks, and technologies to ease the transition into parenthood.

### The problem
+ work life balance
+ annecdotes about coding with children
+ Caffiene becomes more than your friend it become your mistress
+ Your co-workers may talk about exotic things like "Free Time", Drinking Beer, and Sleeping for 10 hours
+ Listening to a podcast or watching a tech talk with the baby is sleeping on you is totally far game
  + Just remember to prep everything you are going to need before your wife hands over the baby
  + Best thing I ever bought for use with my IPad bluetooth headset
+ You are going to forget things
  + Get a todo list
  + I like Todoist
  + I like LastPass
  + I like sunrise calendar
  + The new Outlook App is great at consolidating your life
+ Your kids are only young once, so try not to use the electronic baby sitter too much
+ If the baby is not crying ... don't bother it
+ Warn your co-workers you will not be firing on all cylinders
+ Know that your temper will be short and relax
+ You will eventually get all your smarts back
+ You will wonder what you did with all your time before kids
  + we would sleep till 9 am on Sundays, then make waffles and watch meet the press. Is George Bush still the President?
+ If your wife is on maternity leave see if you can trade her some early even hours for a contiguous block of sleep for you
  + 6 hours of contiguous sleep is worth more than 8 hours of interrupted sleep
  + Remind your wife that this will be the only time this child is a baby and that she should take more maternity time
+ Discuss with your wife the plan of attack in the middle of the night, make sure she is explicit
  + You will reach a point where you will rationalize not following the plan so you can get more sleep
+ There are apps which time how long a baby has feed, when was the last time you changed the baby, and how many times it has peed...use them
+ All time which you have to be away from your child becomes precious to your career.
  + Use commute time to catch up on podcasts
  + lunch breaks should still be used to break away from your project's issues, but you can and should use that time to further a goal
+ No matter how cute and wonderful your baby is...you will think ok, that thing is awesome, can I go back to work now?
+ Interestingly enough your co-workers are NOT interested in color or consistency of your child's poop
+ If you can go out to a company happy hour, it will seem like a vegas style oasis, big lights lots of excitement and booze
  + about 20 minutes into the happy hour you will be wondering if your kid is doing something amazing
+ Your threshold of entertainment is lowered dramatically
  + You will put the baby on a blanket in the middle of the room and just stare at it...note it won't do anything
  + after about 2 - 3 months your baby will smile at you, and you will simultaneously think two things. 1) It is about time you did something anything 2) I will do anything...literally anything for you to smile at me again
    + A baby's smile and laugh is the purest form of joy
    + you will try to create an infinit loop of smiles and laughs
+ Do not take picture of the baby coming out with your phone...your wife will not appreciate it...had to learn that the hard way
+ Exercise becomes a lower priority
  + Try 7 minute workouts in the morning
+ Find a babysitter and go out every once in awhile
  + the baby will be fine
  + you and your wife will be better for it
+ Make no bones about it for a significant period of time after the baby is born...you will be in survival mode
+ My threshold for raising my children is to limit sever head trama till they are older than 1
+ While the iphone is a great invention...zipper pajama's were created by a true genius
  + snap pajamas are more difficult than writting a web app in assembly
    + button pajamas - forget about it - it is like coding blind folded
